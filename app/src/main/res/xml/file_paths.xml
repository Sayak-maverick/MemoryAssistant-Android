    file_paths.xml - Defines which directories FileProvider can access

    This is required for camera functionality - it tells Android where
    we're allowed to save temporary photo files.

    <external-files-path> maps to getExternalFilesDir()
    This is a safe, app-specific directory that gets cleaned up when
    the app is uninstalled.
